Whaddup mah bois, this is you oneplus3 maintainer, Dhanush here. Well, about myself, im more of a minimalist guy. Love experimenting with stuff. Also an EDM-head. Ill let you in on my configs and mods below.

#### My Setup:

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/XAqvHIr"><a href="//imgur.com/XAqvHIr"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

 - So i use [nova launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher). Simple. Dependable. Minimal.
 - Standard on the recent phones, compact navbar is kinda my thing. Easily operable be it from the right or left.
 - Wall? [Here ya go](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5XFnoxJjZMt1dECP7). [Actually, get more lit walls here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/LZMyK1ZDFtfJIebg1)

#### Mods:

So I've already told ya im an EDM-head. With that said, here are the audio mods that I use. The one i currently use is V4A (2.5.0.5), with notification helper module and compatibility patch, along with audio modification library to make em all work in harmony. Ill share my V4A config below. Google Sans is a mandatory font for my roms. For theming, [Swift Installer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brit.swiftinstaller) is my best choice, with an ever-growing list of apps being themed, with custom colour choices. 

_Here are my V4A configs: [Sicc](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1kte2PIB7P9uJzmSGpfInc1ZVDXmwE2oP)_
*Best served with some [sick drops](https://open.spotify.com/user/7m4cbioyd76tlhvv72buha2oq/playlist/1ooqKoXOTYqDM0kbVE3xVG?si=h1t3ViizRH6LvH3IPRSowA)*

So that's all bout me n my stuff, lemme know if y'all got any suggestions or even some dope drops for me to try :P in the comments below.
